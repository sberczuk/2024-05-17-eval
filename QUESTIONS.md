General points:
- I hit a couple of snags with Pydantic type mapping and alsp revisiting some Python knowlede

- Checking for Duplicate Claims? can we do that based on the claim data?
- I'm assuning that each claim is only for a single provider, regardless of lines
- I'm using Floats to represent currency. I should be using Decimals. I need to understand how that fits into the Pydantic and SQL Model schema
- I did not get to the Docker Compose with Postgres step.
